## Hello! 

I am a PhD student in Andre Martins’ [SARDINE lab](https://sardine-lab.github.io/) at Instituto Superior Técnico, working in the DECOLLAGE project. I am interested in Machine Learning and NLP, especially structured latent variable models and sparse representations. I have a been a research intern at Amazon Alexa twice. I used to work on computational models of Ancient Greek syntax at the [Pereus Project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/). I have an MSc in Computer Science from Tufts University, an MA in Philosophy from the University of Chicago, and I did my BA in Philosophy at Yale University.
